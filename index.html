      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a pragmatic introvert with a dark sense of humor and a love of rich colors.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I came from a difficult past that has given me a no-nonsense attitude mixed with a streak of 'let's see what happens.'</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Gardening, reading, instigating shannignans, and cooking!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Less daily interaction with customers/clients, freedom to try new methods as long as the objective is achieved, shorter term projects > 1 yr, and to work with a group of interesting, intelligent, dedicated collaborators.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>According to my friends, I live in the boonies. Also known as Burien, WA. LOL</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I like the idea of building all kinds of things from a very regimented environment. Deep learning and AI are intriguing concepts.</p>
